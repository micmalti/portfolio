/*
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime intended for running JS code server-side. PHP and Java
run their tasks synchronously, whereas Node.js uses a single thread that can support 
thousands of connections concurrently. This optimizes throughput and scalability in 
apps with many I/O operations but must be avoided for CPU-intensive applications.

Node.js is built on a V8 JavaScript engine which executes code in a series of steps.
Firstly, a global execution context (usually an anonymous function) is created to serve 
as a space to run all the code that the engine receives. Every function call is pushed
to the top of the call stack (a LIFO queue) and a new function execution context is 
created, similar to the global execution context except for the arguments object which
contains a reference to all the parameters passed into the function. Besides, a stack 
frame is also created; this is a location in memory where parameters and variables are
stored. This memory gets cleared when the function returns and the whole context then
gets removed from the call stack.

Functions that might take a long time to complete are written with a callback function
that encapsulates the code for later execution when the blocking action is resolved. 
This returns control to the engine and defers the rest of the execution until after the
call stack has been cleared. The callback queue stores callbacks, including those 
triggered by external events, such as mouse clicks.

During code execution, the call stack keeps track of the currently executing function
context, the callback queue keeps track of any execution contexts that need to be run 
at a later stage, and the event loop periodically checks if the call stack is empty. 
When all execution contexts are executed, the event loop takes the first function that
entered the callback queue, places it on the call stack to be executed and the process
repeats itself until both the call stack and callback queue are empty.

/*
The cluster module supports two methods of distributing incoming connections:
1. Round-robin (default); the master process listens on a port, accepts new connections
   and distributes them across the workers in a round-robin fashion, with some built-in 
   smarts to avoid overloading a worker process.
2. The master process creates the listen socket and sends it to interested workers. The
   workers then accept incoming connections directly, which should improve performance.
   In practice, distribution tends to be very unbalanced due to OS scheduler vagaries.
   Loads have been observed where over 70% of all connections ended up in just 2 
   processes, out of a total of 8.

A middleware function extends the capabilities of a route handler by adding information

a given condition isn't met to trigger a response, the function will execute the next

/*
The above functions are executed for all request types, these may be changed to execute

/*
A server can have a number of HTTP services which clients can call using HTTP requests.
Every HTTP request has a method which determines its intention, the standard ones being
GET, POST (creating data), PUT (updating data) and DELETE. 

REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is a convention for building such HTTP services.
Simple HTTP protocol principles are used to create, read, update and delete data, 
collectively referred to as CRUD operations. A REST API allows data exchange without 
the need for clients to know anything about the server other than the resource URL and
the action required (usually GET to fetch data). 
*/

app.get('/json', (req, res) => {
  res.json({"message": "Hello json"});  // API response
});

/*
When building an API, we have to allow users to communicate to us what they want to get
from our service. This is achieved by using route parameters, named segments of the URL
delimited by /, where each segment captures the value of the part of the URL which 
matches its position. The captured values can be found in the req.params object.
*/

app.get('/:word/echo', (req, res) => {
  res.json({"echo": req.params.word});
});

/*
Another way to get input from the client is by using a query string, delimited by a ?,
which consists of field=value couples separated by an &. Express parses data from the 
query string and populate the req.query object. Some characters, such as %, cannot be 
in URLs so they have to be encoded in a different format before you can send them. 
*/

app.get('/name', (req, res) => {
  const { first: firstName, last: lastName } = req.query;
  res.json({"name": `${firstName} ${lastName}`});
});

/*
In REST convention, POST is used to send data to create new items in the database. For
such requests, the data is hidden in the request body and encoded like a query string,
the default format used by HTML forms; multipart/form-data encoding is used to upload 
binary files, whereas more complex JSON data structures can be handled with Ajax.

Middleware can also be chained inside a route definition. This approach is useful for 
performing some validation on the data; at each point of the middleware stack you can 
block the execution of the current chain and pass control to functions specifically 
designed for error handling, or to pass control to the next matching route to handle
special cases. 
*/

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }), (req, res) => {
  const { first: firstName, last: lastName } = req.query;
  res.json({"name": `${firstName} ${lastName}`});
});

/*
Sensitive information should be stored as environment variables in a .env file to keep
it private. Remember to put this file in the .gitignore list.
*/

// To add an environment variable inside .env, strictly follow this syntax:
VAR_NAME=uppercase

// To access environment variables from the app:
process.env.VAR_NAME

// To listen on a given port, putting the server in a running state:
app.listen(5000);

/*
AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server 
behind the scenes, making it possible to update parts of a web page without reloading 
the whole page. This is achieved using a browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object which 
requests data from a web server following a specific DOM event. The response is read by
JS and proper action is taken.
*/

// Syntax for creating an XMLHttpRequest object:
const ajaxObject = new XMLHttpRequest();

/*
Since modern browsers prevent access across domains for security reasons, both the web 
page and any file that is fetched must be located on the same server.
