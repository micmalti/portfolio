Abner Coimbre talks about how the educational system puts too much emphasis on code cleanliness and sidesteps the nurturing of problem solving. He puts on an audioclip of Casey Muratori in which he says that one should "only care about [clean code] insofar as it has an effect on our end product." The code that Muratori is referring to here isn't meant for production but solely to help define, or better understand, the architecture of the software being developed. Understandably, it makes sense that "prematurely cleaning it [would] actually be worse than just wasting time; it may lead us down wrong paths and end up having us have to do gyrations to make stuff work together because we have segragated it in a bad way early on."

Only when the problem is solved should one concern himself with the cleanliness of code, which doesn't adhere to a prescribed set of rules because such a set doesn't exist, only *heuristics*. And, notably, what constitutes as clean code varies according to the software lifecycle and maintenance, not on the codebase itself.

Coimbre opines for a data-oriented way to designing software.
