*The following is a summary of the PMR submission guidelines (retrieved October 28, 2024) for the purpose of submitting a manuscript for consideration on the Journal of Portfolio Management, a PMR publication.* 

While portfolio optimization models are interesting to JPM readers (the keyword "ETF" came up in 25 out of the 44 articles published on JPM in 2023), their implementation would be the domain of the quant group at an asset management firm, not the portfolio manager or CIO. Consequently, rigorous mathematical programming models are best sent to operations research-type journals. Furthermore, advanced statistical models for parameter estimation and strategy development would be best sent to academic quantitative finance journals or applied financial econometric journals. 

Approximately 400 papers are submitted to JPM each year and only 44 papers are published. Authors of papers that are not found to be suitable for further review will be notified within two weeks. Papers that are reviewed will typically take between 12 and 16 weeks for the review process to be completed. 

## Layout

- Paper size: 8½ × 11 inches
- Margins: 1 inch all around
- Single spaced text
- Paragraphs have 12 points of space before
- First line of paragraphs indented one tab stop
- Pages numbered at bottom center

## Style

- Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary for spelling 
- The Chicago Manual of Style for punctuation and other points of style

## Word count

4000 words, excluding the abstract, exhibits, and references. However, the editor of JPM may accept articles within 2500 - 7000 word range. Content such as detailed empirical results is preferred in supplementary information.

## Title

- Not more than 12 words and 50 chars

## Abstract 

- 160 words
- Define any acronyms upon first use

## Highlights

- 3 bullet points (no more than 40 words or 85 chars), highlighting key findings
- May be used instead of the abstract

## Keywords

- 4-6
- Avoid unique or technical words
- JEL codes

## Main text

- 12-point Times New Roman

Use strong introductory paragraphs to describe the salient points of the article, how they add to prior research in the area, and provide a brief explanation of the reasoning or analysis that supports them. If applicable, they should convey how an investment professional can use the findings, results, or conclusions in a practical way.

## Headings

- Up to 3 levels
- Top-level headings appear in bold uppercase. Second-level headings are indented and bold. Third-level headings appear as bold in-line paragraph headings.
- The first heading in an article should appear after the introductory material

## Footnotes

- 10-point Times New Roman
- Not more than two sentences
- Only if necessary

## Conclusion

Similar to the abstract, though it may include references and technical terms used throughout the article.

## Declarations of Interest

- Add: "The author reports no conflicts of interest. The author alone is responsible for the content and writing of the paper."

## References

- APA-styled reference list (include papers’ DOI numbers where applicable)
- Author-date citations as outlined in The Chicago Manual of Style 17th Edition, Chapter 15 (for JPM, this extends to the reference list format)

## Exhibits

- Call all tabular or graphical material "Exhibits" (not "Figure" or "Table")
- Use Arabic numbers
- Keep to a minimum, opting for inclusion in the appendix (supplementary information)
- Use vector graphics format (Illustrator EPS or MATLAB SVG files), otherwise a minimum resolution of 300dpi
- Except for the simplest tables and charts, the text should explain how to read each exhibit. For tables that report statistical results, the text should direct readers to the key values and clearly explain what they mean.
- Authors are encouraged to submit articles with exhibits in colour. Although PMR publications are generally printed in black and white, the online version can show colour exhibits.

### Tables
- 9-point Times New Roman or larger for the content of regular cells
- Bold for row and column headings
- 12-point Times New Roman for the title of the table
- 8-point Times New Roman for explanatory notes and sources
- Use 0.01 inches for top and bottom cell margins and 0.04 inches for left and right cell margins
- Use borders (lines) sparingly
- Align values on the decimal point
- Use the same number of decimal points for the same sorts of numbers
- Centre headings, columns (only the first one is left-aligned), and numbers correctly

### Charts
- 9-point Times New Roman for axis labels and legends
- 12‑point bold Times New Roman for title
- Borders and axes should be 0.5-point solid black lines
- Gridlines should be 0.25-point solid gray (35%) lines; include both horizontal and vertical gridlines for line charts
- Title and the labels for the x-axis should appear at the bottom of the plot area Legend (if any) may be placed either within the chart or below the plot area
- If the x-axis covers a range of dates spanning more than four years, the axis should start on January 1 of the first year and end on December 31 of the last year without indicating a specific date (format yyyy). 
- Data lines should use varying thickness, shading, and dashes to clearly differentiate data series

### Equations
- Display called-out equations on separate lines, aligned on the same indents as the text paragraphs and with no punctuation following
- Number equations consecutively throughout the paper in Arabic numbers at the right-hand margin
- The text should describe and explain the relationship represented by the equation and clearly define all terms used in the equation. Use a text box to explain any operation signs, Greek letters, or any other notation that may be unclear.
- Leave space around operations signs such as plus and minus everywhere.
- In many cases, it is better to place content that is heavy with equations in an appendix.
