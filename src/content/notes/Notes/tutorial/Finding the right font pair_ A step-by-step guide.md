Selecting the right font pairing involves a blend of personal taste and current trends, but it is also a choice that must align with the intended tone and context of the design specification.This guide outlines a multi-step process to move beyond inspiration and make informed typographic decisions for your project.

## 1. Look for variable fonts only

To ensure readability, typographic spacing must be adjusted for size: tight for large headlines and open for small text. Optical sizing resolves this by providing dedicated font versions of a typeface where every design detail, from spacing to letter proportions, is optimized for use at different sizes. A [variable font](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-variation-settings) will have this by default if it comes with an optical size variation axis.

:::note
Adding an optical size axis will typically double the font file size, although this depends on the family and the other axes used – it can range between 1.2 — 2.6x.

But variable fonts are much more than that. They fundamentally shift typographic control to the user by replacing predefined static weights and styles (like "regular" or "bold") with a continuous spectrum of customizable attributes. This allows for fine-tuned adjustments to weight, width, and other axes based on specific design preferences.

## 2. Pair complimentary fonts

[Inspiration](https://fontofweb.com/) is definitely important for professionals in this space, but for up-and-coming entrants, especially those who are self-taught, a more quantitative approach can actually yield an equally valid outcome that is also free from any novice mistakes.

Use [Fontpair](https://fontpair.co/) to find matching font types for the fonts which you have found in the previous step.

## 3. Evaluate readability and character design

Visually inspect the fonts. Key characters to look out for are numbers (particularly *0* and *7*), symbols, and the letters *a*, *j*, *g*, and *f*. For instance, Poppins may cause readability issues due to its *a* being similar to *o*, [among others](https://medium.com/@chiahoushen/design-system-selecting-a-new-typeface-for-better-readability-e42af6c22c27).

## 4. Research real-world use cases

Validate your shortlist by searching for real-world examples on sites like Fonts in Use, Typ.io, or MaxiBestOf. Also, consult communities like r/Typography for any prior discussions involving your font options and the intended use case, or start your own to receive valuable feedback from more experienced designers.
